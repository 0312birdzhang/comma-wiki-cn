For installation in a Honda,  see this [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62NIAyTxcjk tutorial video to find out correct placement and installation with a panda and giraffe.]

For installation in a Toyota, see this [https://youtu.be/jGNMsypQd8Q instruction video].
  
# Mount the EON adapter.
## Horizontal aim - The inner edge of the fan (the side closest to the heatsink) should be directly underneath the stock LKAS camera.  Overall aim may appear a little left of center, but post-Flippening code takes that into account.
## Vertical aim - The horizon should be at or just a little above center
## If you are installing with the Giraffe and Panda, install the Giraffe and Panda first and ensure that the USB can reach the Panda
## The previous preferred mount was to remove the mirror and mount the EON/NEO directly to the mirror mount. However, EONs come with the sticky GoPro mount. The instructions below will give you a good chance of installing a windshield mount level and straight:
## Experiments have revealed that the most important mounting aspect is the rotation (or roll) of the windshield mount. This method has repeatedly worked well:
### Park between two street lines (for instance: inside the yellow turn lane on a low-traffic street) Then put the car in drive with the parking brake on, and foot on the brake.
### Adjust the lanes until they look centered on the EON. 
### Rotate the EON until the path line is perfectly vertical between the lines.
## If you prefer a Mirror Mount, here is a 3d printable STL file for a [https://github.com/commaai/neo/blob/master/case/honda_mirror_togopro.stl Honda Rearview Mirror Mount to GoPro adapter] (may fit other cars too)

Consider following the [https://community.comma.ai/wiki/index.php/Gridded_UI Gridded UI wiki] for precise EON placement.
